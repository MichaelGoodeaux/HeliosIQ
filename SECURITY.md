# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following versions of HeliosIQ are currently supported and maintained:

- Latest release: v1.x.x

Older versions are not supported and may have known vulnerabilities. Please ensure you are using the most up-to-date version for security and stability.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability in HeliosIQ, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Please follow these steps:
1. **Do not open a public issue**: To prevent any malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerability before it is fixed, please do not open a public issue or pull request for the vulnerability.
2. **Email secops.heliosiq@gmail.com**: Send a detailed report to our security team at secops.heliosiq@gmail.com. Please include:
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
    - Any affected versions, configurations, or environments.
    - Potential impact and severity.
    - Any exploit code (if applicable).
3. **We will acknowledge receipt**: Upon receiving your report, our security team will acknowledge it within 48 hours.
4. **Public disclosure timeline**: After we have investigated and fixed the issue, we will publish a fix in a timely manner. We typically aim to release patches within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities. Once the fix is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability in a responsible manner.

## Security Practices
We take security seriously and follow these best practices to ensure the safety and integrity of HeliosIQ:

1. **Code Review**: All pull requests are reviewed by at least one other developer to identify potential security issues before they are merged.
2. **Dependency Management**: We regularly update and audit our dependencies to ensure that there are no known vulnerabilities. Dependencies are managed through `npm` and `Terraform`.
3. **Least Privilege**: We follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that services and users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS for web traffic, AWS KMS for data storage encryption).
5. **Environment Variables**: Secrets such as API keys, credentials, and tokens are stored securely in environment variables or services like AWS Secrets Manager, never hardcoded in the codebase.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: We use logging and monitoring systems (such as AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana) to detect unusual activities and potential security breaches.
7. **Regular Audits**: The security of the project is regularly audited by internal and external security experts. Vulnerabilities and issues identified during audits are promptly addressed.

## Security Considerations for Deployers
If you are deploying HeliosIQ in your own environment, please consider the following:

- **API Authentication**: Always enable authentication and access control for the API endpoints using IAM roles, API keys, or AWS Cognito.
- **Network Security**: Configure firewalls, VPCs, and security groups to limit access to sensitive resources. Restrict network access to only trusted IPs or subnets.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform to manage and securely deploy infrastructure. Always ensure that your configurations are secure and follow best practices for secrets management.
- **Keep Systems Updated**: Ensure that your operating systems, Docker images, and dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
